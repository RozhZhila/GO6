# Validation & Quality Assurance Lead

As the **Validation & Quality Assurance Lead**, my role is to ensure that all system requirements are complete, consistent, clear, and testable. I focus on checking the quality of the requirements, identifying possible issues early, and confirming that they meet stakeholder needs before development starts.

---

## Main Responsibilities
- Review all functional and non-functional requirements for consistency and completeness.  
- Identify at least two risks related to unclear, missing, or conflicting requirements.  
- Propose validation methods to confirm requirements are correct (e.g., reviews, prototyping, test cases).  
- Prepare the validation report (`REQUIREMENTS_VALIDATION.md`) summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Techniques Used
- **Requirements Review:** Team/stakeholder review sessions to detect missing or unclear requirements.  
- **Prototyping:** Simple mockups to confirm that user needs are correctly captured.  
- **Test Case Derivation:** Creating sample test cases from requirements to ensure they are measurable and testable.  
- **Traceability Check:** Ensuring each requirement links to stakeholder goals and can be verified later.

## Risk Examples
1. Some user requirements may be incomplete or based on unclear stakeholder input.  
2. Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security) may not have measurable criteria.
