## Project Overview and Goals

The **Student Job and Skill Development Platform** is a web application built **by students, for students**. Our primary goal is to **empower students to grow, learn, and build their future together** by bridging the gap between academic life and real-world experience.

The platform is designed to provide a **safe, verified space** where students can:
* Showcase their abilities.
* Collaborate on projects.
* Gain experience through **jobs, internships, freelance tasks, and volunteering**.
