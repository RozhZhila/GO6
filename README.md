# Student Job and Skill Development Platform

*Team G_06:* Aya Ardalan, Ara Omed, Danya Kawkaz, Rozh Zhila, Sahand Amir, Resa Talaat  

## Project Overview

The *Student Job and Skill Development Platform* is a web application built *by students, for students, designed to connect them with opportunities that match their skills and career goals. The platform provides a **safe, verified space* where students can showcase their abilities, collaborate on projects, and gain experience through *jobs, internships, freelance tasks, and volunteering*.  

Our primary goal is to *empower students to grow, learn, and build their future together* by bridging the gap between academic life and real-world experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- *Frontend:* Contains the React.js components, pages, and styling.  
- *Backend:* Laravel application handling authentication, project management, and API endpoints.  
- *Database:* SQL scripts for creating tables, seeders, and relationships.  
- *Docs:* Proposal documents, design diagrams, and project reports.  
- *Tests:* Unit and integration tests for backend and frontend features.

## Current Practice (Revised)

Students currently rely on platforms like *LinkedIn, social media groups, university forums*, and local sites such as jobs.krd and volunteer.krd to find projects, jobs, or collaborations. These platforms are *not student-specific, often dominated by professionals, which makes it **difficult for students to be noticed* or feel comfortable. Opportunities are scattered, and *quality and safety vary, highlighting the need for a **dedicated, verified student platform*.  

---

## Novelty (Revised)

The platform stands out for its *student-first approach*:

- *Verified student membership* ensures authenticity and trust.  
- *Companies and organizations* have limited access — they can post internships, volunteer roles, or projects *without overshadowing students*.  
- Emphasis is on *growth, collaboration, and creativity*, rather than professional achievements alone.  
- A *safe, supportive, and inclusive environment* encourages active student participation.

## Technical Approach (Revised)

We are using *Agile methodology with Scrum* to develop the platform iteratively through *1–2 week sprints, focusing on testing and feedback. Key features include **student verification, project posting, collaboration tools*, and more.  

*Technologies & Tools:*

- *Frontend:* React.js (interactive and responsive UI)  
- *Backend:* PHP Laravel (robust server-side logic)  
- *Database:* MySQL (scalable storage for users, projects, and opportunities)  
- *Authentication:* Secure student verification via email or university ID  
- *Hosting:* Namecheap or Hostinger (secure deployment)  
- *Development:* Iterative sprints with continuous testing and feedback  

---

## Risks (Revised)

The *most significant risk* is implementing a *secure and reliable student verification system* because it requires *integration between frontend and backend*.  

*Mitigation strategies:*

- Use *official university emails* and optional student ID checks.  
- Develop and *test verification early* in the project sprints.  
- Regular security audits and unit testing to maintain data integrity.

## Proposed Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

We propose the *Agile SDLC model* for this project:

- *Why Agile:*  
  - Allows *iterative development*, adapting quickly to user feedback.  
  - Supports continuous testing, reducing risk of errors.  
  - Encourages *team collaboration and incremental feature delivery*, which aligns with our student-first focus.  

- *Implementation:*  
  1. *Planning:* Define user stories and prioritize features.  
  2. *Design:* Create mockups, wireframes, and database schemas.  
  3. *Development:* Implement features in sprints with regular code reviews.  
  4. *Testing:* Perform unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.  
  5. *Deployment:* Deploy updates iteratively to hosting servers.  
  6. *Feedback & Improvement:* Gather user feedback and refine features continuously.  

This approach ensures the platform evolves *according to student needs* while maintaining *high quality and security*.
