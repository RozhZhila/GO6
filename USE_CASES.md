## Key Actors

| Actor | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Student** | A verified student user can create a profile, post and apply for opportunities, and collaborate on projects. |
| **Organization** | Verified groups such as companies, NGOs, research centers, student initiatives that post jobs or projects for students. |
| **Administrator** | Developers/moderators who verify accounts, manage reports, and maintain the platform's security and functionality. |
| **External Service** | Third-party systems that integrate with the platform, such as email authentication services, file storage systems, or APIs for verification & notifications. |



Every registered user on the platform is assigned one of the three primary human actors; Student, Organization, or Administrator. Signing up requires an non-human actor, an "External Service", in order to access the rest of the system, which verifies the user's email address and password to grant the proper permissions & accessibility.

Students are the primary users of the platform. A verified student can:
1. Create & edit a profile that highlights their skills, education and experience
2. Browse & apply for opportunities
3. Post opportunities & manage their applicants
4. Receive notifications
5. Collaborate on projects
Students can fill in personal, educational, and skill related information on their profile and can upload supporting files. Profiles can be viewed by anyone.
   
Organizations (such as companies, non-governmental organizations, or academic groups) play a key role in providing experience for students. Verified organizational accounts can:
1. Create a profile that showcases their business
2. Post opportunities & manage their applicants
3. Receive notifications

Administrators act as moderators and quality controllers of the system. They're responsible for approving opportunity listings, check relevancy and legitimacy of opportunities, and maintain a safe and trustworthy environment. They also oversee reports or flagged content, removing or editing entries that violate platform guidelines.

External Services are non-human actors that are used to support functions such as email or university ID authentication, file storage for resumes and project files, and automated notifications. These integrations improve system reliability and verify user identities.
